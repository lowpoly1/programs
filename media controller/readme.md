# Media controller
### This is a very basic media control software written in Python.
Features:
- Volume control
- Play/pause
- Forward and back seeking
- opens URLs

Todo:
- Add config file to edit what links are available
- Pop-up menu with list of links, or a scrollable list; to fit more links in the same space
- More functionality

I use this in conjunction with the spacedesk software to allow me to use a tablet as a control panel for my PC
